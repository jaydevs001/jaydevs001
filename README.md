- HelloðŸ‘‹ I'm @jaydevs001, a passionate learner diving into the world of software and web development. ðŸš€
- Iâ€™m interested in Software development and Web development.
- I'm currently exploring the exciting realms of software development and web development. My goal is to build a solid foundation in these fields and contribute to meaningful projects.
- Whether itâ€™s mastering new programming languages or creating dynamic web applications, Iâ€™m all in!
- Iâ€™m currently learning python,jva,etc
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building android Applications and other basic utility Applications
- Feel free to reach out if you have any advice, want to collaborate, or just want to chat about development!
- Here's my LinkedIn profile link; www.linkedin.com/in/james-olusanya-641b75319
-  I'm lookingforward to being able to create basic android apps or utility programs to help in daily routines.
-  My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a 
                        passion for design.
                        Given that producing a modern website 
                        requires the combination of design, server technology, 
                        and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having 
                        experience in both design and front-end dev make a better website;
                        one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful, 
                        accessible to all, making the most optimal user experiences
                        on all my projects.
- ðŸŒŸ Goals
Master Web Development: Create responsive and interactive web applications.
Contribute to Open Source: Collaborate on open-source projects and make meaningful contributions.
